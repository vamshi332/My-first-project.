Project overview:- Executed a comprehensive data analysis project involving data wrangling, imputation, merging, and feature engineering across multiple structured datasets related to employee project allocations. Leveraged Python (Pandas) to clean, transform, and derive actionable insights from organizational project data.
->Key Responsibilities & Analytical Contributions:
 -Integrated multiple datasets including Project Details, Employee Information, and Seniority Levels using efficient joins on common keys (ID), enabling holistic organizational reporting.
 -Cleansed and handled missing values in the 'Cost' column using a running average imputation technique, preserving data continuity and minimizing analytical distortion.

->Performed data enrichment by:
 -Splitting full names into 'First Name' and 'Last Name' fields for better granularity.
 -Calculating a performance-based 'Bonus' column for employees who successfully completed projects (5% of project cost), showcasing logic based conditional operations.
 -Created a unified reporting dataset (final_data_with_bonus.csv) that encapsulates project metadata, employee demographics, seniority levels, and reward computations—suitable for executive dashboards and HR performance tracking.
 -Demonstrated data transformation techniques such as string parsing, NAN handling, aggregation, conditional logic, and CSV I/O operations in a structured pipeline.

Skills & Tools Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools: pandas for data manipulation and analysis

Key Outcomes:
Built a clean, consolidated dataset ready for advanced reporting or visualization.
Created a scalable and modular notebook to replicate similar business intelligence tasks across departments.
Demonstrated practical business logic implementation by associating project performance with employee rewards.
